# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).r, I added some hover effects on the card using CSS transform property to scale them a little percentage higher than their normal sizes.
